I’ll assume your base URL is:
http://localhost:8080/studentapp/api/students
If your context path is different (for example /StudentInformationSystem), just replace it accordingly.

1️⃣ Get all students
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/studentapp/api/students

2️⃣ Get a specific student by ID
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/studentapp/api/students/1

3️⃣ Add a new student (POST)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/studentapp/api/students \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "name": "Luna Park",
           "age": 22,
           "major": "Electrical Engineering"
         }'

4️⃣ Update an existing student (PUT)
For example, update student with ID 3:

curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/studentapp/api/students/3 \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "name": "Catherine Smith",
           "age": 22,
           "major": "Cognitive Science"
         }'

5️⃣ Delete a student by ID
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/studentapp/api/students/4

6️⃣ Example: filter or search (if supported)
If your API supports query params (optional feature):

curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/studentapp/api/students?major=Computer%20Science"

7️⃣ Check response headers (debugging)
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/studentapp/api/students

8️⃣ Pretty print JSON output (macOS/Linux)
If you have jq installed, you can pretty print the responses:
curl -s http://localhost:8080/studentapp/api/students | jq
